Website statement


Hello, my name is John Harnos and I am a 3D Generalist undergrad. I am currently attending the New York Institute of Technology as a Computer Graphics major. I enjoy creating and sharing new artwork and ideas. On this site I am displaying some of my portfolio works I’ve created over the span of my college career, and other works that I think best illustrate my technical ability. I primarily use 3ds Max and Photoshop, but I have experience in Unity, Illustrator and 
After Effects.
